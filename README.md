## ***1. Problem Statement: Why this Idea?***
Bangladesh grapples with a severe sewage problem, especially in dense cities. The outdated system, strained by a booming population, simply can't handle the wastewater. Most sewage flows untreated into rivers and canals, contaminating the water with harmful bacteria and threatening public health. This pollution harms aquatic life and endangers the livelihoods of those who depend on these waterways. While Bangladesh is building new treatment facilities, significant investment and upgrades are needed to overcome this challenge.
Bangladesh's dream of becoming a _"Smart Bangladesh"_ faces hurdles due to its persistent sewage woes. Untreated sewage clogs drains and canals, hindering their ability to effectively channel rainwater during heavy monsoon seasons. This overflow contributes to flooding, a recurring nightmare in Bangladesh. Flooding disrupts infrastructure, displaced people, and damages property, stalling progress towards a smart, resilient nation. Investing in proper sewage treatment is crucial not just for public health but also for Bangladesh's smart city ambitions.

## ***2. Impact of damage in Bangladesh***

### I.	Wealthy:
 *	Potential Issues: Unpleasant odors, clogged drains, property damage from floods (indirect).
 *	Mitigation Strategies: Private septic tanks, residence in better-drained areas.

### II.	Middle Class:
 *	Health Risks: Increased risk of waterborne diseases (diarrhea, dysentery) due to reliance on shared sanitation or older septic systems.
 *	Water Quality: Sewage contamination can affect piped water quality, further jeopardizing health.
 *	Mitigation Strategies: Boiling water, improved hygiene practices (may not fully eliminate risk).




### III.	Poor & Vulnerable (Slums/Informal Settlements):
 *	Health: Highest risk of waterborne diseases due to overcrowded and poorly-maintained sanitation facilities. Sewage overflow can seep into homes, creating a constant health hazard.
 *	Displacement: Floods caused by clogged drains disproportionately affect these communities, displacing them and destroying belongings.
 *	Livelihoods: Sewage pollution harms fish populations, impacting food security and income for many.
 *	Limited Mitigation Strategies: Few resources to invest in private sanitation or relocate to safer areas.


> [!Example: Dasherkandi plant]
> The existing sewage treatment system is outdated and overwhelmed by the growing population. Dhaka's recently built Dasherkandi plant, the largest in South Asia, can only handle a small portion (around 20%) of the city's sewage.
